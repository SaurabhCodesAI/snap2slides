## üéØ **Authentic Elements to Include**

### **Real Development Challenges**
- CORS debugging sessions that lasted hours
- API rate limiting discovered during heavy testing  
- Mobile compatibility issues on real devices
- Performance bottlenecks with large files
- TypeScript errors and resolution process

### **Learning Moments**
- "Spent entire afternoon debugging why iPhone couldn't upload files"
- "Realized single API key wasn't enough after hitting limits"
