• AI analyzes and extracts key content using Google Gemini
• Generates professional PowerPoint slides instantly
• Works perfectly on mobile devices

🛠 Technical highlights:
• Next.js 14 + TypeScript for type safety
• Multi-API failover system (learned this the hard way!)
• Mobile-first responsive design
• Real-time processing with progress tracking
• Production deployment on Vercel
